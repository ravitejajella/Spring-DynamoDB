In this project, I integrated AWS DynamoDB with a Spring Boot application. I configured an IAM group and user, assigned the user to the group, and granted full access to DynamoDB. Within the Spring Boot application, I defined an Employee entity and implemented CRUD operations to seamlessly interact with DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval.
